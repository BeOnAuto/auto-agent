## 🍅 Pomodoro Workflow

One atomic test + implementation per cycle (5-15 min).

**Planning a Pomodoro:**

- Independent, valuable, small, testable
- Define: value added, code surface size (S/M/L), complexity (S/M/L)
- 1-2 line approach description
- Create `pomodoro-plan.md` with sections: TODO / DONE
- Commit the plan with initial pomodoros

**Execution:**

1. Write ONE failing test (Red)
2. Write MINIMAL code to pass (Green)
3. TCR: `test && commit || revert` (include plan update)
4. Refactor if needed
5. TCR: `test && commit || revert`
6. Move pomodoro to DONE in the `pomodoro-plan.md`, commit with TCR

**TCR Command:**

```bash
pnpm test --run && \
  git add -A && git commit -m "<COMMITIZEN FORMAT>" || \
  git checkout -- packages/<package>/
```

## 🎯 TDD + 100% Coverage

All thresholds enforced at 100%. Tests drive the code.

| Do                              | Don't                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Let tests drive all code        | Write code without a failing test first  |
| Add branches only when tested   | Defensive `??`, `?:`, `if/else` untested |
| Test all error paths            | Leave error handling unverified          |
| Remove dead code after each run | Keep unused code "just in case"          |

**NEVER Exclude Files to Dodge Coverage**

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  Excluding a file from coverage to avoid testing it is FORBIDDEN.    ║
║  "Hard to test" code (file system, dynamic imports, network, etc.)   ║
║  → Inject dependencies and mock them. That's what mocks are for.     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Coverage exclusions are ONLY for:

- Type-only files (interfaces, type definitions)
- Barrel exports (index.ts re-exports)
- Files that are genuinely 0% logic (pure declarations)

If you're tempted to exclude a file because it's "infrastructure" or "integration-focused" — STOP. The coverage requirement exists precisely to force testable design.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

### Behavior First, Everything Else Emerges

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  Start with BEHAVIOR. Always.                                         ║
║  Types, interfaces, data structures — these emerge to serve behavior. ║
║  If it doesn't affect runtime outcomes, it's not the design.          ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**The Core Insight:**

Software exists to _do things_. A program that compiles perfectly but produces wrong outputs is worthless. A program with ugly types that produces correct outputs is valuable. This tells us where to focus.

Behavior is the only thing that matters at runtime. Everything else — types, interfaces, abstractions, patterns — exists solely to help us write correct behavior more reliably.

**The Wrong Way (Structure-First):**

```
1. Design the data shapes / types / interfaces
2. Define the abstractions and relationships
3. Finally, implement the actual behavior
```

This is backwards. You're making decisions about shape before you understand what transformations you need. You're building a warehouse before you know what you're storing.

**The Right Way (Behavior-First):**

```
1. What OUTCOME do I need? (input → output)
2. Write a test that asserts on that outcome
3. Implement the simplest code that produces the outcome
4. Let structure emerge to support the behavior
```

**Why This Works:**

- You only create structure that's _actually needed_
- Tests verify behavior, which implicitly validates any supporting structure
- You discover the real shape of data by _using_ it, not by speculating
- Refactoring is safe because behavior is locked in by tests

**Practical Rule:**

Your first test for any feature should call a **function** and assert on its **output**. Whatever types, interfaces, or data shapes that function needs will get created _because_ the function needs them — not before, not separately, not speculatively.

```ts
// ❌ WRONG: Starting with structure
// "Create User type"
// "Create UserService interface"
// "Design the repository pattern"

// ✅ RIGHT: Starting with behavior
it("creates user with generated id", () => {
  const result = createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  expect(result).toEqual({ id: expect.any(String), name: "Alice" });
});
// Types, interfaces, whatever — they emerge because this function needs them
```

**The Mantra:**

> "What should this function return when given this input?"

If you can't answer that question, you're not ready to write code. If you _can_ answer it, write the test first, then make it pass. The rest takes care of itself.

## 📝 Testing Guidelines

### Test Title = Spec

The `it('should...')` title defines what you're testing. Body proves exactly that.

```ts
// ✅ Title matches body
it("should reject empty usernames", () => {
  const result = validate({ username: "" });
  expect(result.valid).toBe(false);
});

// ❌ Body does more than title claims
it("should reject empty usernames", () => {
  const result = validate({ username: "" });
  expect(result.valid).toBe(false);
  expect(result.errors).toContain("Username required"); // second spec
  expect(logger.warn).toHaveBeenCalled(); // third spec
});
```

### Stubs Over Mocks

Use deterministic stubs. Mock at boundaries only when stubs aren't possible.

```ts
// ✅ Deterministic stub
function createTestIdGenerator() {
  let counter = 0;
  return () => `test-id-${counter++}`;
}

it("creates user with generated id", () => {
  const generateId = createTestIdGenerator();
  const user = createUser({ name: "Alice" }, generateId);
  expect(user).toEqual({ id: "test-id-0", name: "Alice" });
});

// ❌ Mocking couples tests to implementation
it("creates user with generated id", () => {
  const mockGenerateId = vi.fn().mockReturnValue("user-123");
  const user = createUser({ name: "Alice" }, mockGenerateId);
  expect(mockGenerateId).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### Assert Whole Objects

Catch structural changes. Don't cherry-pick properties.

```ts
// ✅ Catches any unexpected changes
expect(result).toEqual({ type: "USER", name: "Alice", processed: true });

// ❌ Misses if extra properties added/removed
expect(result.type).toBe("USER");
expect(result.processed).toBe(true);
```

### Squint Test

All tests should look identical when you squint: **SETUP → EXECUTE → VERIFY**

```ts
// ✅ Single clear structure
it("transforms user to uppercase", () => {
  const input = { type: "user" }; // SETUP
  const result = transform(input); // EXECUTE
  expect(result).toEqual({ type: "USER" }); // VERIFY
});

// ❌ Multiple execute/verify = split into separate tests
it("does too many things", () => {
  const result = transform({ type: "user" });
  expect(result.type).toBe("USER");
  const updated = updateResult(result); // second execute
  expect(updated.modified).toBe(true); // second verify
});
```
